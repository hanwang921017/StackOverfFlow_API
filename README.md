# StackOverfFlow_API
StackOverfFlow API with Python

(1)About the API, because there is a limitation on the number of messages you can download everyday, so we can get the all question Ids first and then get the coresponding answers by a few days. But we need to remember how many question Ids we have used, so we can continue from where we stop. There are some other methods to overcome the limition, you can search it if you need all the data in one day.

(2)The R code in the RCommends folder is used to visualise the network build by the asker Ids and Answerer Ids we get form the API.

(3)In the Plots folder, there are output pictures and two 3D pictures of the whole network and the giant component. For the two 3D pictures, they are saved as webpage format and you can download them and open them in Google Chrome. Because there are too much overlap in the 2D plots, so maybe the 3D plots can show you a better network.
